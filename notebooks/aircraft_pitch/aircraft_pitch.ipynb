As mentioned previously, the lead compensator will help add damping to the system in order to reduce the overshoot in the step response.\n\nContinuing with the design of our compensator, we will next address the parameter $\\alpha$ which is defined as the ratio between the zero and pole.

Since our current phase margin (with the addition of K) is approximately 10.4 degrees, an additional 50 degrees of phase bump from the lead compensator should be sufficient. Since it is known that the lead compensator will further increase the magnitude of the frequency response, we will need to add more than 50 degrees of phase lead to account for the fact that the gain crossover frequency will increase to a point where the system has more phase lag.
